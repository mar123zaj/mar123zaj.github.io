Welcome to my personal blog! This is the place where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and lessons learned throughout my journey in software development.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about a variety of topics, including:

- **Software Architecture** — patterns, trade-offs, and real-world decisions
- **Web Development** — modern frameworks, tools, and best practices
- **Career Growth** — navigating the tech industry and continuous learning
- **Project Retrospectives** — what went well and what I'd do differently

## Why Write?

Writing is one of the best ways to solidify understanding. By explaining concepts to others, I deepen my own knowledge and create a reference for my future self.

I also believe in the power of community knowledge sharing. If something I write helps even one person solve a problem or see things from a new perspective, it's worth the effort.

## Stay Tuned

This is just the beginning. I have plenty of topics lined up and I'm excited to start sharing them. Feel free to explore the rest of the site — check out my [portfolio](/portfolio) or learn more [about me](/about).

Thanks for reading!
